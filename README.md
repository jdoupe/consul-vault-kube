# consul-vault-kube
Yet another implementation of consul and vault on kubernetes

Hopefully this is a little better than most.  It includes TLS for both consul and vault, ACLs for consul, and GOSSIP encryption for consul as well.

Seems to work well on Docker for Mac - Edge (kubernetes), and likely works on minikube.

Follow steps laid out in consul-vault-notes.txt.
